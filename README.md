If you log out and then log in as another user, such as Patrick Star, a new chat window will open for your conversations with SpongeBob.

### Unread Messages Indicator

- **New Chat Window**: Each time you start a conversation with a different user, a new chat window will be created.
- **Unread Messages**: Any new conversations or chats that you haven't checked yet will be highlighted in blue. This visual cue helps you easily identify messages that require your attention.

## Chat History

When you click on a chat, you will find all the previous conversations, memos, photos, and files associated with that user. This allows you to easily revisit important discussions and shared content.


**Chat Content**: All your past messages, notes, images, and files will be displayed in the chat history, providing a comprehensive view of your interactions.

* **Edit Status Message**: You can also change your status message from this chat view by clicking the "Edit" button, allowing you to keep your friends updated on your current mood or activity.

## User Blocking

If you choose to block a user, their status will change to "Block User". This action prevents any further communication with that user.

* **Blocking a User**: When you click on "Block User," the blocked user will be unable to send you messages. In the chat window, you will see a notification stating, "You cannot send a message," indicating that communication is no longer possible.

![1721765395361](image/README/1721765395361.png)

* **Login as Blocked User**: If you log in as the blocked user, you will not see their profile picture or status message. Instead, a message will appear saying, "You are Blocked!" This reinforces that you cannot send messages to the user who has blocked you.
